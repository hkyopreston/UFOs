# UFOs

The main goal of this project is to create a website for UFO sightings. This data is displayed in a table format that is visually pleasing and easy to read. 

This project also created filters within the website so that you can easily narrow down the UFO sightings. Through the filter search, you can filter by: 

    - Date
    - City
    - State
    - Country
    - Shape
    
The technologies that were usd to complete this project were JavaScript ES6+, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS. 

One recommendation that I have for further development is to have more than one page on the website. It would be helpful if there were 'click buttons' for each UFO sighting that would lead you to a new tab that provides additional data and articles about that particular sighting. This would involve more in depth JavaScript coding in order to create new buttons. It would also involve another web scrape in order to find articles about the particular sightings and then linking that data to the website.
